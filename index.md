## I _Looooove_ to make things for the Internet

---

I have over 10 years industry experience working in-house and for agencies. I have helped make award-winning projects for clients like VisitEngland, AO, Microsoft, BAE and Nikon

Whilst originally a PHP Developer, I have now moved into front end development, and now specialise in creating applications with VueJS. This has allowed me to have a great in-depth understanding of the whole web design process, from wireframe up to deployment.

Away from web development, I love spending time with my wife and two sons. I'm also a keen PlayStation gamer and enjoy watching films.
