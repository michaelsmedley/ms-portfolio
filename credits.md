I have spent a lot of time building this site, even going as far as to create a
[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/TvmuMdVh76aQJTbxRBji7E/2021?node-id=302%3A57){target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"} and pull my components and styles out in [Zeplin](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/60e033df0de4581083e86379){target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}.  However, the final build wouldn't be complete without the help of a lot of people who dedicate time and resources, and then open source them as well!

Here I'd like to give a bit of credit to people whose contributions helped me to get this site finished.
